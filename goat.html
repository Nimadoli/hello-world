                <p>Creamy and distinct in flavor, goat cheese is a dairy product enjoyed around the world.</p>
                <p>Goat cheese comes in a wide variety of flavors and textures, from soft and spreadable fresh cheese to salty, crumbly aged cheese. </p>
                <p>Although it’s made using the same coagulation and separation process as cheese made from cow’s milk, goat cheese differs in nutrient content. </p>
                <p>Additionally, goat cheese is digested differently than cow’s milk and is a hypoallergenic alternative for those allergic to cheese made from cow’s milk. </p>
                <p>This article explains the nutritional benefits of goat cheese and provides creative ways to add this delicious cheese to your diet.

            What’s more, goat’s milk contains more medium-chain fatty acids than cow’s milk. These are rapidly broken down and absorbed by the body and are less likely to be stored as fat (

        <p>Certain fats found in goat’s milk may promote health in other ways, as well.</p>

        <p>
            Test-tube and animal studies have found that capric acid is effective in combating

            It has been found that cheese protects probiotics during the digestion process, allowing greater numbers to be delivered to the gut where the bacteria contribute to health (

        <p>Many people find that switching from cow’s milk products to those made from goat’s milk is easier on their digestive system.</p>
        <p>This is because goat milk products, including cheese, have a different protein structure than cow’s milk products. They are also naturally lower in lactose.</p>
        <p>Lactose is the main carbohydrate in milk produced by mammals.</p>
        <p>
            It is estimated that up to 70% of the world’s population has trouble digesting lactose, which causes symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, gas and diarrhea (
            <hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health">
                <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5726035/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-5r4717">10</a>
            </hl-trusted-source>
            ).
        </p>
        <p>
            Experts suggest that most people with lactose malabsorption can consume a small amount (up to around 12 grams) of lactose before experiencing digestive symptoms (
            <hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health">
                <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20186234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-5r4717">11</a>
            </hl-trusted-source>
            ).
        </p>
        <p>
            Since goat milk contains less lactose than cow’s milk, products made from goat’s milk, including yogurt and cheese, may be a better choice for those with 
            <a href="/nutrition/lactose-intolerance-101" class="content-link css-5r4717">lactose intolerance</a>
            .
        </p>
        <p>However, those with lactose intolerance should keep in mind that softer cheeses contain more lactose than hard, aged cheeses, regardless of what milk the cheese is made from.</p>
        <p>
            Goat milk also has lower levels of A1 casein than cow’s milk, a type of protein which may cause milk sensitivity symptoms in some people by causing inflammation in the gut (
            <hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health">
                <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951635/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-5r4717">12</a>

            ).
        </p>
        <p>Goat milk products contain mostly A2 casein, a type of protein that has been shown to be less allergenic and less inflammatory than the A1 variety.</p>
        <p>For example, a study in 45 people with lactose intolerance found that drinking milk containing A1 casein caused digestive distress and increased markers of inflammation. </p>
        <p>
            When these people switched to milk containing only A2 casein, digestive symptoms were not aggravated and intestinal inflammation improved significantly (

        <p>Goat milk contains a unique fatty acid profile that has been associated with several health benefits.</p>
        <p>For example, dairy products made from goat’s milk have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties and may even help decrease hunger.</p>
        <p>Goat’s milk is higher in short- and medium-chain fatty acids than cow’s milk. In particular, goat’s milk contains high amounts of the medium-chain fatty acids capric acid and caprylic acid.</p>
        <p>These fatty acids are digested rapidly, providing an immediate source of energy which leads to increased feelings of satiety.</p>
        <p>
            A study in 33 adults demonstrated that consuming a goat milk-based breakfast containing goat cheese significantly reduced the desire to eat and resulted in decreased ratings of hunger compared to a cow’s milk-based breakfast (

        <p>Aside from increasing fullness, studies have shown that goat’s milk products may help reduce inflammation in your body. </p>
